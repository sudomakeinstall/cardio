# cardio

`cardio` is a simple web-based viewer for 3D and 4D ('cine') medical imaging data,
built primarily on [trame](https://github.com/kitware/trame),
[vtk](https://github.com/kitware/vtk), and
[itk](https://github.com/insightsoftwareconsortium/itk).  `cardio` can render sequences
of mesh files (e.g., `*.obj` files), segmentation files (e.g., `*.nii.gz` files with
discrete labels) and volume renderings of grayscale images (e.g., `*.nii.gz` files with
continuous values).  `cardio` is launched from the commandline and may be configured via
commandline arguments, a static TOML configuration file, or a combination of the two.

## Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
$ cd /path/to/your/project
$ uv init
$ uv add cardio
$ . ./.venv/bin/activate
```

### Snapping to a segmentation feature

The MPR views can lock onto a segmentation feature: the centroid of a group of
labels (`label`), the interface between two groups (`interface`), or a point along
the line joining two such interfaces (`traverse`).  That selection can be made in
the Snap & Align panel, or written down so the app opens with it already applied:

```toml
[snap]
segmentation_label = "BL_Labels"
mode = "traverse"
labels_a = [1]
labels_b = [2]
labels_c = [3]
traverse = 50            # percent of the way from the A|B interface to B|C
locked = true            # hold the origin on the feature, frame to frame
orientation_locked = true  # hold the views in the fitted plane
```

The same fields are available on the commandline, either individually or as JSON:

```bash
$ cardio --snap.mode traverse --snap.labels_a '[1]' --snap.labels_b '[2]' --snap.labels_c '[3]'
$ cardio --snap '{"mode": "interface", "labels_a": [1], "labels_b": [2], "locked": true}'
```

Reset returns to this configuration rather than to an empty panel.  A label that
the segmentation does not contain is reported and dropped rather than refusing to
start.

### Developing

Ensuring you have all required dependencies:

```bash
$ uv sync --all-extras
```

Pre-commit checklist:

```bash
$ ruff check --fix
$ ruff format
$ pytest -v
```

Uploading:

```bash
$ uv version --bump major # Year
$ uv version --bump minor # Month
$ uv version --bump patch $ Day
$ git tag -a $(cardio --version) -m "Release $(cardio --version)"
$ rm -rf dist/
$ uv build --no-sources
$ git push origin main --follow-tags
$ uv publish --token <pypi_api_key>
```
